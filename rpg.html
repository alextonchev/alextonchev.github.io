	<h3> 1. Spider-Man: Remastered</h3> 
	<div class="review_text">
	<p> Like God of War 4, this game is also in the must-play category of games made in the past 5 years or so. Spider-Man is basically a perfect game when it comes to making you feel like Peter Parker and Spider-Man at the same time.  Playing as Spider-Man is why the game gets most of its praise. Swinging around New York City feels so amazing and effortless it really immerses the player and yes you feel like you are Spider-Man. Every time you start swinging an epic and orchestral track starts playing and it just adds to the atmosphere of you being a superhero. All the Spider’s movement is clean and flows perfectly: you swing from one building to another one, to a pole, wall running around a corner, and finally getting enough air to do multiple flips and tricks midair. The same flow of swinging is transferred to the combat as Spider-Man is fighting a horde of 15 criminals he uses his superior agility and speed to outmaneuver all of them and the player feels every action. Not only that but he has eight different web shooters that can aid him with different types of enemies.  Any time you are not wearing the suit the game gets slightly boring as Peter has to fix different gadgets and the player is forced to solve mini puzzles, slowing down the pace of the game. There are even sections where you play as MJ or Milles, doing very basic “stealth missions” which could have been avoided with a quick cut-scene. However, as this is an RPG it shows you every aspect of Peter’s life and I think adds to the experience. Visually the game is gorgeous and even though you move at high speeds you almost never have to see it render different textures or shaders. The story is predictable but very interesting and is filled with tons of Easter eggs from the comics and movies. It takes around 24 hours to fully complete the game and another 15 hours to get all achievements, and collectibles and to finish the 3-pack DLC. I have played around 45 hours and I still will boot the game to just swing around. </p>

	<h4> 2. The Witcher 3<h4>
	<div class="review_text">
	<p> The Witcher 3 has been the king of RPGs ever since its release in 2015. It has everything an RPG needs: an amazing story, a massive and immersive world, different builds, and equipment that require hours of work to get. You play as the Witcher Geralt of Rivia, the emotionless and brutal legendary monster hunter. The game starts off with you tracking down the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg who your love interest is also and likes to often disappear. When you find her, you learn that your adopted child, Ciri is being chased down by the Wild Hunt. The Wild Hunt wants to capture Ciri and use her pure Elven blood and gain universe-breaking powers. The combat is relatively stale with Geralt having a few spells he can cast, but most of the work is done by his two different swords: silver for monsters and steel for humans.  While Geralt is a mutant, he is not superhuman and on harder difficulties of the game, you will easily die from three hits that are dealt by a nearby monster. The more impressive aspect of the game is all the dialogue and different outcomes that Geralt can choose. If you choose to accept a side quest and then forget about it, often time by the time you come back to it the NPC will say that the monster you were hired to kill has either left or killed one of the family’s loved ones. It is this type of realism that makes this game immersive and so captivating to play. Every choice you make impacts the end result of the game, in my first play through I made some greedy choices and later paid the price for them. There are even quick-time choices, you have a limited time to make a choice and each one has a different consequence. However, if you are thorough and pay attention to the story, and do some exploration there is always enough evidence around you for you to make the best choice possible. The soundtrack of this game is also amazing with much of its inspirations coming from Slavic traditional folk which I very much enjoy. I have played around 50 hours and done one and a half playthroughs of the main story and I still have barely scratched the surface of the content that is packed in the game. Along with the 2-pack DLC, there are well over 150 hours of exploration and immersion for the Witcher. </p>

	<h4> 3. Undertale <h4>
	<div class="review_text">
	<p> Undertale was made by one person, Toby Fox in just around 3 years. This passion project of his is now arguably considered the best turn-based RPG of all time. You play as Frisk a young boy who falls into the Underground and his goal is to escape back to the surface. This game has a very simple gameplay loop, you encounter an enemy, and you have three different options each time: fight, act, or spare. Undertale gives the player the option to not just murder everything in sign but talk and get the know the monsters and understand how they feel. These three options each have their own endings: normal, pacifist, and genocide endings. The true RPG feel of the game comes when you realize that depending on which choices you make very different outcomes and new characters are introduced. In terms of game mechanics, the game is simple, when in a battle your soul is represented by a red heart on screen and different enemies will throw projectiles at you, and just have to move around and avoid them. However, the soundtrack is in my opinion one of the best ever created for a video game. It is all in 8 bit but conveys so much emotion and build the atmosphere perfectly. This soundtrack has no mistakes in it. I have beaten the game two times and have about 15 hours. It still has many secrets that I have to explore but the overall experience was a treat. </p>
