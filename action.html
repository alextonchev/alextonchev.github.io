	<h3> 1. Prototype 2</h3> 
	<div class="review_text">
	<p> Prototype 2 was one of the first games that I fully completed and mastered which is why it holds a special place in my heart. NYC is overrun with a massive epidemic virus caused by a former Gentech scientist Alex Mercer. It has affected everybody in the city mutating people into zombies and other monstrosities. You play as Sargent James Heller from Blackwatch who is on a revenge mission to kill Alex because Mercer killed his wife and daughter. After attempting to kill Mercer, Alex infects you with the virus but Heller gains all of Mercer’s abilities. He is now set on eliminating Gentech and Blackwatch for doing tests and trying to profit from the virus. As the game progresses Heller learns that Mercer killed did kill his wife, but his daughter is still alive and both Mercer and Blackwatch want her. Heller must kill everybody who prevents him from getting back to his daughter. This game is the oldest one on the list, however graphically it still holds up today. In this sandbox, the player can do whatever they want: fly, throw a car, blow up a full military base or go on a rampage in an underground layer. Heller quickly becomes very powerful and gains the ability to mutate his arms as different weapons of destruction. The gameplay is very fun and Heller’s movement is smooth and fast. The game will get boring after about 20 hours of just running around not being able to die due to the about of tools and health you have. That did not stop me from beating the game at least 8 times, 100% in both the main game and the DLC. And let’s be honest you will never get bored of throwing an exploding zombie at a military helicopter. </p>

		<h4> 2. Bayonetta </h4>
		<div class="review_text"> 
		<p> Bayonetta 2 is a classic hack-and-slash that heavily draws inspiration from the Devil May Cry series. In the game, you play as Bayonetta, an Umbra witch that is trying to go to Inferno and save her sister who gets taken there at the start of the game. What this game lacks in story and some would even say a good plot, is very satisfying, fun, and smooth combat. Bayonetta can juggle an enemy in the air for about 7 seconds hitting them with different weapons, kicks, and punches, and then finally does a visually amazing finish as the enemy blows up into pieces. The combat highlight is Bayonetta’s Witch Time, which is triggered when you perfectly dodge an enemy attack, time slows down basically freezing all enemies in place. Going in and out of Witch Time is very satisfying especially when you are chaining combos on multiple enemies at a time. This game has massive action sequences that will start with you fighting on the ground, to you summoning your own beast from Inferno, beating the crap out of an enemy from Paradiso, and then jumping in a mech suit to beat an even bigger boss. While all of that is happening a glorious and epic soundtrack will be playing in the background adding to your epic hack-and-slash experience. I have played through the game twice and never really got bored of all the different weapons, player skins, and collectibles that were in the game. However, I have only played for around 20 hours and basically gave up when I saw that the best item in the game cost around 3 hours of grinding. </p>

<h5> 3. God of War </h5> 
<div class="review_text">
	<p> God of War 4 is considered a must-play ever since it came out, both by fans of the series and newcomers. Kratos (the God of War) has now been transported to Norse mythology, but this time he is not looking for revenge, blood, and murder. The game opens with Kratos making a pyre for his wife who has just passed away while his son is asking how he can help. Kratos tells the boy that they must go to the top of the summit and spread his mother’s ashes, as this was her dying wish. The story of this game is incredible and does a very good job of integrating Norse Mythology with every aspect of the game. The highlight of the gameplay for me was throwing a frost axe anywhere and with a press of a button it come flying back to your hands just like Thor’s hammer. Kratos and his son are always fighting side by side and Atreus is constantly helping his dad by shooting enemies with his bow and arrow. The visuals of this game are astonishing, especially from a special view: everything seems big and massive compared to Kratos and his son giving the game a very alive and real feeling. The combat is fresh and there are many different combos and mix-ups the player can do. For me, the lack of overall movement does bring the experience down a little bit as Kratos is always grounded and cannot really do jump combos. Also, the fact that it takes around 3 min to use the Bifröst to change areas in the game gets old very quickly. I have played the game one time, beaten the main story, and got the most powerful equipment, but never had the desire to play it through again.</p>
