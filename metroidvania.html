	<h3> 1. Hollow Knight </h3>
	<div class="review_text">
	<p> Hollow Knight takes the number one spot for a very simple reason: every aspect of the game is perfectly polished. It is also my favorite single player game that I have had experienced.  You play as the knight, a pure vessel that needs to rid the bug kingdom of Hallownest of an infection that spreads through the dreams of all the inhabitants of Hallownest. Visually the game has a gloomy and dark feel that effortlessly emerges the player in the tight and narrow cracks and crevasses of The map is intricately connected and each new area the player discovers has something of value to the player, both from gameplay and lore perspective. The control over the knight is smooth and all the boss fights are challenging and fun to navigate. There are platforming sections that have taken me 5-6 hours to complete and even more time to complete master.  Even though I have fully completed the game 7 times (played more than 400 hours) and have gotten every ending and achievement possible, I come back to the game every month or so and play the boss rush mode. I have also defeated every boss in the game hitless, a testament to how much I like and respect the combat of Hollow Knight. Essentially, any part of the game is perfectly polished and eve the DLC that came after the initial game are as polished and masterfully crafted just like the base game. </p>

<h4> 2. Ender Lilies </h4> 
<div class="review_text">
	<p> Ender Lilies comes in second because of the setting and story of the game. This game has a very rich and captivating atmosphere that will very effectively submerge the player into its world. You play as Lily, a 5-year-old girl who has just woken up in an unknown place and is surrounded by a horrible infection called the Blight.  Lily is a pure child; she takes the Blight from those around her and cures them. These cured souls then fight alongside her and aid her in her journey to save the whole kingdom. As mentioned above the atmosphere is captivating, a dark and gory landscape that is roamed around by infected creatures. Each new area has secrets that tell more about life before the Blight came raining down. The visuals, while amazing, cannot compare to the phenomenal soundtrack that enhances the experience tenfold. The gameplay is fun and innovative for its genre: you can swap between two sets of three spirits each for fun and innovative combat, and it is up to the player to choose the best layout for each situation. With around 40 hours of playtime, two complete playthroughs, 100% map and item completion, all endings unlocked I have enjoyed this game very much. The combat does tend to get repetitive after around  after around 30 hours and the movement is not as clean or precise as Hollow Knight. However, the exploration, world-building, and storytelling are amazing and have brought out real emotions in me while playing for the first time.  </p>

<h5> 3. The Messenger </h5> 
<div class="review_text">
	<p> Last but not least,  The Messenger starts off by not seeming like a Metroidvania at all. It resembles a 2d platformer with an 8-bit style and is inspired by the Ninja-Gaiden series.  You play as a ninja who just saw his whole village get destroyed by the Demon Army. Luckily the Hero came just in time to save you but got fatally wounded. He tells beckons you to take the all-Powerful Scroll to the top of the nearby mountain and with its power, you will be able to defeat the Demon Army. For the first half of the game, you donâ€™t do any of the typical Metroidvania movements, such as exploring or backtracking, and all the story is given to you rather than having to go out of your way to find it. However, around the halfway point there is a big change, and the game takes a very creative turn. The map opens up and the player is present with the bigger problem that is happening around them. A clear goal is set, and you now need to go further explore the land and discover new areas and abilities. In terms of gameplay, it is simple, with not many controls, and without complicated items or builds. The challenging aspect of the game comes from the level design, in which the simple controls are pushed beyond their limit and the player is forced to use movement and momentum innovations to play around all the obstacles. With around 35 hours, 100% completion, three different playthroughs, and completed the DLC, I can say that it was an excellent game. The soundtrack needs to be highlighted; each new level has a unique theme that perfectly matches the atmosphere, but it becomes even better after the midway point. </p>
